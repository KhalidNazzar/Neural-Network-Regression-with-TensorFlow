# Neural-Network-Regression-with-TensorFlow

First of all, this notebook is written for the purpose of teaching and learning. 
In this notebook I write about creating data to view and fit, one of the most important concepts when working with neural networks are the input and output shapes, steps in modelling with TensorFlow, improving a model, evaluating a model, split data into training/test set, visualizing the data, vizualizing the model, vizualizing the predictions, evaluting predicions(MAE, MSE), running experiments to improve a model - build 3 model and compare their results(with 1 layer and 100 epochs, and with 2 layers and 100 epochs, and with 2 layers and 500 epochs), comparing result, saving a model, loading a model and downloading a model from Google Colab.
